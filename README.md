## Credits

This integration is a fork of [dreame-mower](https://github.com/bhuebschen/dreame-mower) by [@bhuebschen](https://github.com/bhuebschen), itself based on [dreame-vacuum](https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum) by [@Tasshack](https://github.com/Tasshack). It has been reworked to fix cloud connectivity issues, error code mapping, and entity availability specific to the Dreame A1 Pro outdoor mower.
