# Dreame A2 Mower — Home Assistant Integration

Home Assistant integration for the **Dreame A2 robotic lawn mower** (model `dreame.mower.g2408`).

> **⚠️ Status: Alpha, actively reverse-engineered**
>
> This integration is being built from detailed MQTT protocol analysis of a live A2 mower. Settings decoding, telemetry, and live map overlay are being added phase-by-phase. Expect breaking changes on minor version bumps.

## Scope

- **Supported:** Dreame A2 (`dreame.mower.g2408`) only.
- **Not supported:** Any other Dreame mower, any Dreame vacuum, MOVA, Mi branded devices.

If you own another model, use the [upstream project](https://github.com/nicolasglg/dreame-mova-mower) this fork is based on. This fork deliberately strips non-A2 code paths to keep the integration focused.

## Attribution

Forked from [nicolasglg/dreame-mova-mower](https://github.com/nicolasglg/dreame-mova-mower) which is itself derived from the Dreame vacuum HA integration community work. License (MIT) preserved. Upstream contributions are gratefully acknowledged; this fork diverges because the A2 mower uses materially different siid/piid assignments and transport semantics that the upstream project explicitly does not target.
